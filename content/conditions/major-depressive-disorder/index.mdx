# Major Depressive Disorder

## Overview

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), commonly referred to as depression, is a serious mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest, and a range of emotional and physical symptoms. It significantly impacts daily functioning and quality of life.

MDD affects millions of people worldwide and is one of the leading causes of disability globally. With appropriate treatment, most individuals can achieve significant improvement in their symptoms.

## Epidemiology

- **Prevalence**: Approximately 7-8% of adults in the United States experience MDD in any given year
- **Lifetime prevalence**: Up to 20% of individuals will experience at least one major depressive episode
- **Gender**: Women are approximately twice as likely as men to experience MDD
- **Age of onset**: Most commonly begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, though it can occur at any age
- **Geographic variation**: Prevalence varies by region and cultural factors

## Etiology & Risk Factors

### Biological Factors

- **Genetics**: Family history increases risk; heritability estimated at 40-50%
- **Neurotransmitter imbalances**: Dysregulation of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine
- **Neuroendocrine factors**: HPA axis dysfunction, cortisol dysregulation
- **Brain structure**: Changes in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala

### Psychological Factors

- **Personality traits**: High neuroticism, low self-esteem
- **Cognitive patterns**: Negative thinking patterns, rumination
- **Early life experiences**: Childhood trauma, abuse, neglect

### Environmental Factors

- **Stressful life events**: Loss, trauma, major life changes
- **Chronic stress**: Ongoing work, relationship, or financial stress
- **Social isolation**: Lack of social support
- **Medical conditions**: Chronic illness, pain, disability

## Clinical Features

### Core Symptoms (DSM-5)

At least 5 of the following symptoms must be present during the same 2-week period, with at least one being either depressed mood or loss of interest:

1. **Depressed mood** most of the day, nearly every day
2. **Markedly diminished interest or pleasure** in all or almost all activities
3. **Significant weight loss or gain**, or decrease/increase in appetite
4. **Insomnia or hypersomnia** nearly every day
5. **Psychomotor agitation or retardation** (observable by others)
6. **Fatigue or loss of energy** nearly every day
7. **Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt**
8. **Diminished ability to think or concentrate**, or indecisiveness
9. **Recurrent thoughts of death**, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempt

### Additional Features

- **Anhedonia**: Inability to experience pleasure
- **Cognitive symptoms**: Difficulty concentrating, memory problems
- **Physical symptoms**: Headaches, gastrointestinal issues, chronic pain
- **Anxiety symptoms**: Often co-occurs with anxiety disorders

## Diagnosis

### DSM-5 Criteria

- Presence of major depressive episode
- Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment
- Episode not attributable to substance use or medical condition
- Not better explained by other psychiatric disorders

### Assessment Tools

- **PHQ-9**: Patient Health Questionnaire (9 items)
- **BDI-II**: Beck Depression Inventory
- **MADRS**: Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale
- **Clinical interview**: Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation

### Medical Workup

- Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel
- Thyroid function tests
- Vitamin B12 and folate levels
- Consider neuroimaging if atypical features present

## Differential Diagnosis

### Medical Conditions

- **Hypothyroidism**: Can mimic depression
- **Anemia**: Fatigue and low mood
- **Chronic fatigue syndrome**
- **Neurological conditions**: Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease

### Psychiatric Conditions

- **Bipolar Disorder**: Must rule out manic/hypomanic episodes
- **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)**: Chronic, less severe
- **Adjustment Disorder**: Response to identifiable stressor
- **Substance-induced mood disorder**
- **Grief**: Normal bereavement vs. MDD

## Management

### Non-pharmacological

#### Psychotherapy

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: First-line treatment
- **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)**: Effective for relationship-focused issues
- **Psychodynamic Therapy**: Long-term insight-oriented approach
- **Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)**: Prevention of relapse

#### Lifestyle Interventions

- **Regular exercise**: 30 minutes, 3-5 times per week
- **Sleep hygiene**: Regular sleep schedule, 7-9 hours per night
- **Nutrition**: Balanced diet, omega-3 fatty acids
- **Social support**: Maintain connections, join support groups
- **Stress management**: Meditation, relaxation techniques

### Pharmacological

#### First-Line Antidepressants

- **SSRIs**: Sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine
- **SNRIs**: Venlafaxine, duloxetine
- **Atypical antidepressants**: Bupropion, mirtazapine

#### Treatment Considerations

- **Onset of action**: 2-4 weeks for initial response
- **Adequate trial**: 6-8 weeks at therapeutic dose
- **Side effects**: Monitor closely, especially in first 2 weeks
- **Switching strategies**: Cross-taper when changing medications
- **Augmentation**: Add second agent if partial response

#### Special Populations

- **Elderly**: Lower starting doses, monitor for falls
- **Pregnancy/Lactation**: Consider risks vs. benefits carefully
- **Children/Adolescents**: Black box warning for increased suicidality risk

## Prognosis

### Course

- **Duration**: Untreated episodes typically last 6-12 months
- **Recurrence**: 50% risk of recurrence after first episode
- **Chronicity**: 20-30% develop chronic depression
- **Treatment response**: 60-70% respond to first antidepressant trial

### Factors Affecting Prognosis

- **Early treatment**: Better outcomes with prompt intervention
- **Severity**: More severe episodes may require longer treatment
- **Comorbidities**: Anxiety, substance use worsen prognosis
- **Social support**: Strong support network improves outcomes

## Red Flags & When to Refer

### Immediate Referral (Emergency)

- **Active suicidal ideation with plan or intent**
- **Psychotic features**: Hallucinations, delusions
- **Severe agitation or catatonia**
- **Inability to care for self or others**

### Urgent Referral

- **Suicidal ideation without immediate plan**
- **Severe functional impairment**
- **Treatment-resistant depression** (failed 2+ adequate trials)
- **Comorbid substance use requiring dual diagnosis treatment**

### Consider Referral

- **Moderate to severe depression** not responding to initial treatment
- **Need for specialized psychotherapy** (CBT, IPT)
- **Complex comorbidities**
- **Pregnancy or planning pregnancy** (specialized perinatal psychiatry)
