## Evidence Grading System

We use a standardized evidence grading system to indicate the strength of evidence supporting our content:

### Level A: Strong Evidence
- Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
- Meta-analyses of high-quality studies
- Well-established clinical guidelines from recognized bodies
- Strong consensus in the medical literature

### Level B: Moderate Evidence
- Single well-designed RCT
- Well-designed cohort or case-control studies
- Systematic reviews of moderate-quality studies
- Moderate consensus in the medical literature

### Level C: Limited Evidence
- Observational studies
- Case series
- Expert opinion based on clinical experience
- Limited or emerging evidence

### Level D: Expert Opinion
- Expert consensus
- Clinical experience
- Case reports
- Theoretical basis

## Review Cadence

Content is reviewed on a regular schedule based on:

- **High-priority content** (e.g., dosing, contraindications): Every 6 months
- **Standard content**: Every 12 months
- **Stable content**: Every 18-24 months

Content may be reviewed more frequently if:
- New evidence emerges
- Clinical guidelines are updated
- Safety concerns are identified
- Significant changes occur in clinical practice

## Update Process

1. **Scheduled Review**: Content is flagged for review based on the review cadence
2. **Evidence Search**: Current literature and guidelines are reviewed
3. **Content Update**: Content is updated to reflect current evidence
4. **Review**: Updated content is reviewed by a qualified clinician
5. **Publication**: Updated content is published with a new review date
