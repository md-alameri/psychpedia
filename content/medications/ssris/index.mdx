# Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

## Mechanism of Action

SSRIs work by selectively inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) into presynaptic neurons. This increases the concentration of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission.

Unlike older antidepressants (tricyclics, MAOIs), SSRIs have minimal affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors, resulting in fewer side effects and better tolerability.

### Key Pharmacological Properties

- **Selective**: Primarily affect serotonin, not norepinephrine or dopamine
- **Reversible**: Binding is competitive and reversible
- **Time-dependent**: Therapeutic effects develop over 2-4 weeks despite immediate reuptake inhibition

## Indications

- **Escitalopram**: Approved for MDD (ages 12+)
- **Sertraline**: Approved for OCD (ages 6+)
- **Black box warning**: Increased risk of suicidal thoughts/behaviors

#### Renal/Hepatic Impairment

- **Renal**: Generally no adjustment needed
- **Hepatic**: Reduce dose by 50% for moderate-severe impairment
- **Citalopram**: Maximum 20 mg/day with hepatic impairment

## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea (most common), diarrhea, constipation
- **Central Nervous System**: Headache, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence
- **Sexual**: Decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, anorgasmia
- **Weight**: Initial weight loss, potential long-term weight gain

### Serious Adverse Effects

- **Serotonin Syndrome**: Rare but life-threatening
  - Symptoms: Hyperthermia, agitation, hyperreflexia, clonus
  - Risk factors: Drug interactions, overdose
- **Bleeding**: Increased risk of GI and other bleeding
- **Hyponatremia**: Especially in elderly, more common with SSRIs than other antidepressants
- **QT Prolongation**: Citalopram >40 mg/day (contraindicated)
- **Withdrawal Syndrome**: Discontinuation symptoms with abrupt cessation

### Time Course

- **Early (Days 1-7)**: Nausea, insomnia, anxiety (may worsen initially)
- **Weeks 2-4**: Therapeutic effects begin, side effects often diminish
- **Long-term**: Sexual side effects may persist, weight gain possible

## Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications

- **Hypersensitivity** to the specific SSRI
- **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) use**: Must wait 14 days between MAOI and SSRI
- **Citalopram >40 mg/day**: Due to QT prolongation risk

### Relative Contraindications

- **Active bleeding** or bleeding disorders
- **Severe hepatic impairment**
- **Pregnancy**: Consider risks vs. benefits (see below)
- **Epilepsy**: May lower seizure threshold

### Pregnancy & Lactation

- **Pregnancy**: Generally considered relatively safe, but risks exist
  - Paroxetine: Avoid in first trimester (cardiac malformations)
  - Neonatal adaptation syndrome possible
- **Lactation**: Most SSRIs considered compatible with breastfeeding
  - Sertraline and paroxetine preferred (lower transfer to breast milk)

## Interactions

### Drug-Drug Interactions

#### Serotonin Syndrome Risk

- **MAOIs**: Absolute contraindication (14-day washout)
- **Other serotonergic agents**: Triptans, tramadol, linezolid

- **Serum sodium**: Baseline, especially in elderly

### During Treatment

- **Clinical monitoring**: Mood, side effects, suicidal ideation (especially in first 4 weeks)
- **Serum sodium**: Monitor in elderly, especially first month
- **Liver function**: If symptoms suggest hepatic dysfunction
- **Therapeutic drug monitoring**: Not routinely indicated, but may be useful for:
  - Treatment resistance
  - Suspected non-adherence
  - Drug interactions

### Special Monitoring

- **Pediatric patients**: Close monitoring for suicidal ideation (weekly for first 4 weeks)
- **Elderly**: Monitor for falls, hyponatremia, bleeding
- **Pregnancy**: Fetal monitoring, neonatal assessment

## Patient Counseling Points

### Starting Treatment

1. **Onset of action**: "It may take 2-4 weeks to feel better. Don't stop taking it if you don't feel better immediately."

2. **Side effects**: "You may experience nausea, headache, or trouble sleeping at first. These usually improve after a few weeks."

3. **Not to stop abruptly**: "Don't stop taking this medication suddenly. Talk to your doctor first."

4. **Suicidal thoughts**: "If you have thoughts of harming yourself, contact your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately."

### During Treatment

1. **Take as prescribed**: "Take at the same time each day, with or without food (unless your doctor says otherwise)."

2. **Alcohol**: "Avoid alcohol while taking this medication."

3. **Other medications**: "Tell all your doctors about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements."

4. **Pregnancy planning**: "If you're planning to become pregnant or are pregnant, discuss with your doctor."

### Sexual Side Effects

- "Some people experience changes in sexual function. This is common and treatable. Talk to your doctor if this is a concern."

## Clinical Pearls

### Choosing an SSRI

- **Sertraline**: Good first choice, fewer drug interactions, lower cost
- **Escitalopram**: Well-tolerated, fewer interactions, good for anxiety
- **Fluoxetine**: Long half-life, good for non-adherent patients, once-weekly formulation available
- **Paroxetine**: More sedating, good for anxiety, but more withdrawal symptoms
- **Citalopram**: Lower cost, but QT prolongation risk limits use

### Managing Side Effects

- **Nausea**: Take with food, start at lower dose
- **Insomnia**: Take in morning, consider switching to more sedating SSRI
- **Sexual side effects**: Consider dose reduction, add bupropion, or switch to mirtazapine
- **Weight gain**: Monitor, encourage exercise, consider bupropion if significant

### Treatment Resistance

- **Adequate trial**: 6-8 weeks at therapeutic dose
- **If no response**: Switch to different SSRI or different class
- **If partial response**: Consider augmentation (bupropion, mirtazapine, atypical antipsychotic)

### Discontinuation

- **Taper slowly**: Reduce by 25-50% every 1-2 weeks
- **Paroxetine**: Most difficult to discontinue, taper very slowly
- **Fluoxetine**: Easiest to discontinue (long half-life)
- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Dizziness, nausea, "brain zaps," anxiety
